# Pull Requests
Please follow these basic guidelines when submitting pull requests:
  - Follow the Scala style guide
  - Keep commit history clean by squashing non-relevant commits and rebasing onto master prior to a pull request
  - Use the present tense in commit messages ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
